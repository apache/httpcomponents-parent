Building HttpComponents Parent
==============================

(1) Requisites
--------------

JDK 1.7 or later is required in order to compile and run HttpComponents Parent.

HttpComponents Parent utilizes Apache Maven as a distribution management and packaging tool.
Version 3.0.5 or later is required.
Version 3.5.0 is recommended (this is what I am running.)

Maven installation and configuration instructions can be found here:

http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html

You will also need Apache Subversion and Git:

- Apache Subversion: https://subversion.apache.org/
- Git: https://git-scm.com/

These instructions were last used with:

Apache Maven 3.5.0 (ff8f5e7444045639af65f6095c62210b5713f426; 2017-04-03T13:39:06-06:00)
Maven home: C:\Java\apache-maven-3.5.0\bin\..
Java version: 1.7.0_80, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_80\jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: Cp1252
OS name: "windows 8.1", version: "6.3", arch: "amd64", family: "windows"

git version 2.14.1.windows.1

(2) Check local build
---------------------

Run the following to make sure all is well:

mvn clean package

(3) Consider plugin updates
---------------------------

Run the following to see which plugins you could update:

mvn versions:display-plugin-updates -U

(4) Test deploying the SNAPSHOT
-------------------------------

Try deploying the current SNAPSHOT as a sanity check:

mvn clean deploy

(5) Creating a release candidate
--------------------------------

Check the license headers:

mvn apache-rat:check

Check that we have a LICENSE.txt file.

Check that we have a NOTICE.txt file and that it has the proper copyright end year, which should be the current year.

Make sure the POM shows the correct version and that it is not a SNAPSHOT.

Tag the release candidate:

git commit -am "Update version numbers for release 9"
git tag -s 9-RC1 -m "Tag release 9-RC1"
git push

Dry-run the release:

mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true


Run the release:

mvn release:clean
mvn release:prepare

Deploy:

mvn deploy
