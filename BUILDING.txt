Building HttpComponents Parent
==============================

(1) Requisites
--------------

JDK 1.7 or later is required in order to compile and run HttpComponents Parent.

HttpComponents Parent utilizes Apache Maven as a distribution management and packaging tool.
Version 3.0.5 or later is required.
Version 3.5.0 is recommended (this is what I am running.)

Maven installation and configuration instructions can be found here:

http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html

You will also need Apache Subversion and Git:

- Apache Subversion: https://subversion.apache.org/
- Git: https://git-scm.com/

These instructions were last used with:

Apache Maven 3.5.0 (ff8f5e7444045639af65f6095c62210b5713f426; 2017-04-03T13:39:06-06:00)

Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: Cp1252

git version 2.14.1.windows.1

libgcrypt 1.7.8

(2) Check local build
---------------------

Run the following to make sure all is well:

./mvnw clean package

(3) Consider plugin updates
---------------------------

Run the following to see which plugins you could update:

./mvnw versions:display-plugin-updates -U

(4) Test deploying the SNAPSHOT
-------------------------------

Try deploying the current SNAPSHOT as a sanity check:

./mvnw clean deploy

(5) Creating a release candidate
--------------------------------

Check the license headers:

./mvnw apache-rat:check

Check that we have a LICENSE.txt file.

Check that we have a NOTICE.txt file and that it has the proper copyright end year, which should be the current year.

Make sure the POM shows the correct version and that it is not a SNAPSHOT.

Tag the release candidate:

git commit -am "Update version numbers for release 9"
git tag -s 9-RC1 -m "Tag release 9-RC1"
git push origin 9-RC1

Dry-run the release:

./mvnw release:prepare -DdryRun=true

Run the release:

./mvnw release:prepare

Deploy:

./mvnw deploy -Prelease

Login to https://repository.apache.org and close the RC. 
Keep note of the repository location, for example: https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachehttpcomponents-1065

Publish to dist folder:

Check out the dist folder for this component:

set VERSION=9
set RC_VERSION=9-RC1

mkdir %RC_VERSION%
cd %RC_VERSION%
set RC_DIR=%cd%
copy %REPO_PATH%\httpcomponents-parent-%VERSION%.pom .

ALSO: Copy SHA1 and MD5 files from https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachehttpcomponents-????
svn commit -m "Apache HttpComponents Parent %RC_VERSION%" 

(6) Call for a VOTE

(10) Send Announcement Email
----------------------------

Since this is an internal component, announcing the release to dev@hc.apache.org should be enough.
